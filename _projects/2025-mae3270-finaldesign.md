This assignment pulls together several topics such as materials selection, fracture, fatigue, strain gauges, stress analysis and finite element analysis. I designed an instrumented torque wrench that measures applied torque using strain gauges integrated into the handle. The project created a geometry that meets safety requirements for yielding, fracture, and fatigue while achieving the required sensing performance. The final design was validated through simulation, demonstrating that it satisfies all functional and structural objectives.
