## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/kate-headshot.png" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Katherine Ruelan. I am a Marine Corps veteran and current undergraduate student at Cornell University studying mechanical engineering with a graduation date of May 2027. 

In the Marine Corps, I worked as a ground radio and circuit board repair technician. Following my military career, I worked as a production group leader and production supervisor at a contract manufacturing company making circuit boards and other electro-mechanical assemblies. While working full-time, I began taking classes at Rowan College at Burlington county, where I earned my Associate of Science in Engineering in May 2024 with a 4.0 GPA. I transferred to Cornell the following fall semester. 

After one year of studies at Cornell, I worked as an electronics engineering intern at Northrop Grumman on the avionics integration team in the aeronautics sector. I am excited to continue my career within the intersection of mechanics, electronics, and aerospace.
